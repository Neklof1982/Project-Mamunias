  "technique_permanent_title": "Permanent Polish",
  "technique_permanent_desc": "Permanent polish is a widely popular technique that allows nail polish to last significantly longer than traditional nail polish. Unlike regular polish, which simply air-dries, permanent polish requires curing under a UV or LED lamp. This process ensures a shiny, durable, and scratch-resistant finish that keeps nails looking flawless for several weeks. Itâ€™s an ideal option for individuals who want a long-lasting, polished look without having to worry about frequent touch-ups or chipping. With its ability to maintain a fresh and vibrant appearance over time, permanent polish has become a favorite choice for those seeking both beauty and practicality in their manicure routine.",

  "technique_softgel_title": "Soft Gel Nails",
  "technique_softgel_desc": "Soft gel nails are an excellent intermediate option between natural nails and acrylics. They are light and flexible, providing a natural finish that perfectly adapts to the original nail shape. One of the main advantages of soft gel nails is that they are less damaging to natural nails compared to other techniques such as acrylic or hard gel. The soft gel formula is less dense and does not require aggressive filing for either application or removal. Additionally, it can be safely used to extend nails without harming to the natural nail, making it a healthier and gentler option for nail enhancement.",

  "technique_gel_title": "Gel Nails",
  "technique_gel_desc": "Gel nails are one of the most popular and widely used techniques in manicure salons due to their excellent durability and professional-looking finish. This method involves carefully applying a gel layer over the natural nail, which then hardens under a UV or LED lamp. Gel nails are known for their strength, making them an ideal choice for people with weak or easily broken nails. They also provide a more natural and seamless finish compared to acrylic nails, as the gel conforms much better to the natural shape of the nail. Despite their long-lasting and sturdy nature, gel nails remain flexible and comfortable to wear throughout the day.",

  "technique_acrylic_title": "Acrylic Nails",
  "technique_acrylic_desc": "Acrylic nails are a classic and durable option for those seeking strong, long-lasting nails with excellent resilience. This technique conbines a liquid monomer with acrylic powder, which is then applied over the natural nail or on an extension. Once dried, the acrylic forms a solid, strong, and resistant layer that provides excellent protection. Although acrylic nails are harder than gel nails, they can also be somewhat more fragile if not properly cared for and maintained. This method is perfect for those who want longer nails or a strong, reliable base to create detailed nail designs.",
  "technique_acrylic_img_alt": "Acrylic Nails",

  "technique_polygel_title": "Polygel Nails",
  "technique_polygel_desc": "Polygel nails are a unique blend of gel and acrylic nails, combining the best features of both techniques. Polygel is lightweight, flexible, and highly durable, giving nails a natural look with the same strength as acrylic. Additionally, polygel is applied without using harsh chemicals, which makes it a gentler and less damaging option for natural nails. The application process does not require any filing, significantly reducing the risk of harming the natural nail. Furthermore, polygel nails require minimal maintenance, as they rarely lift or peel, making them an excellent choice for those seeking convenience and durability.",
